== PeopleSoft Performance Analyzer

You are running a PeopleSoft application and you want to see how your system is performing?

Here is a tool for you.

This application fetches data from the PeopleSoft Performance Monitor, PeopleSoft appliaction and (optional) from other applications on a daily base and shows statistics of this data. It cummulates all performance times of a transaction type (e.g. open 360 page) and keeps this data as long as you want.

Furthermore you can define business processes (a collection of different transactions) and see their performance development.

You can easily integrate other non-PeopleSoft systems, just a stored procedure for the data import is necessary.

Requirements:
- PeopleSoft (any application)
- PeopleSoft Performance Monitor (ships with PeopleTools)
- Oracle database
- Basic knowledge of Ruby on Rails
- Installation of the "oracle_enhanced" database adapter for Ruby

Installation:
- Get this application 
- Create a new oracle schema (e.g. PPERF)
- Deploy the basic tables (not in Rails)
- Deploy the stored procedures for data import
- Configure a DBA_JOB for the daily import
- Done

--> all installations steps for Oracle are in doc/Installation/*
